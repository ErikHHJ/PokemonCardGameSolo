This site is a pokemon battle game that I made for fun, and is not part of any school submission. It is riddled with copyrights and not hosted live anywhere. 
## Description
- The pokemon and their stats are taken from the pokeAPI, but they are hard-coded in javascript objects written by myself. The images are PNG's from google and not from the API. I took the names of the moves and chose two. Damage numbers are made up.
- You start by picking a pokemon of your choice, at which point the code picks one of the same pool of pokemons at random. 
- The battle will start after picking, and it will always be the player's turn first. After pressing one of your moves, the enemy pokemon will take damage according to the move you clicked, the hp bar will update, and the enemy pokemon will use one of its moves back, at random.
- Even if the opposing pokemon is defeated, it will still use its move back, so there is a chance to draw. This is to eliminate the advantage of the player. 
- The message box will correctly display the moves that are being made, and will tell you if you have won the battle, lost the battle, or if it is a draw. After the match is over, you can no longer use any moves.
